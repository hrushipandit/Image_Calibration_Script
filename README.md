# Image_Calibration_Script

This code snippet is designed to calibrate a camera using multiple images of a chessboard pattern. It involves several steps, including finding chessboard corners in images, camera calibration, undistortion of images. The code snippet was made primarily referring to the OpenCV documentation Tutorial. https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html

Using the OpenCV library in Python, three images of checkboards were calibrated and undistorted. The code is present in the Image_Calibration.ipynb file while the folders contain the images and the obtained results.
